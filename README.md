I have been hired by the City of Charlotte to develop an intelligent traffic monitoring system.
As a POC, I am given a single camera feed and asked to showcase how the technology can
track cars taking different paths on the highway. The camera feed captures three different
routes: Path 1.) exit and go right, Path 2.) exit and stay straight, Path 3.) do not exit.
My overall task is to count the cars for each of these three paths and save a cut out of the
segmentation mask for the cars that cross each path.
